## üéØ Project Creation Best Practices

### **1. Crafting Effective Prompts**

#### **Be Specific and Detailed**
```bash
# ‚ùå Too vague - AI will make assumptions
npm run director:new "Make a game"

# ‚ùå Too simple - misses key details  
npm run director:new "Racing game"

# ‚úÖ Clear genre and core mechanics
npm run director:new "2D top-down racing game with power-ups"

# ‚úÖ Detailed with style and features
npm run director:new "Retro-style arcade shooter with multiple weapon types, power-ups, and boss battles"

# ‚úÖ Complete vision with specific elements
npm run director:new "Tower defense game with unique upgrade paths, special abilities, and environmental hazards"
```

#### **Include Key Game Elements**
Always specify:
- **Genre**: Racing, shooter, platformer, puzzle, etc.
- **Style**: Retro, modern, pixel art, realistic, etc.  
- **Core Mechanics**: Jumping, shooting, building, collecting, etc.
- **Unique Features**: Power-ups, upgrades, special abilities, etc.

#### **Examples of Well-Crafted Prompts**
```bash
# Platformer with clear mechanics
npm run director:new "Metroidvania-style platformer with ability unlocks, backtracking, and interconnected map"

# Strategy with specific systems
npm run director:new "Real-time strategy game with resource management, unit building, and tech trees"

# Puzzle with unique twist
npm run director:new "Physics-based puzzle game with gravity manipulation and portal mechanics"

# Action with progression
npm run director:new "Top-down roguelike with procedural levels, weapon crafting, and character progression"
```

### **2. Project Naming Strategy**

#### **Use Descriptive Names**
```bash
# ‚ùå Generic names
--name "Game1"
--name "MyGame"  
--name "Test"

# ‚úÖ Descriptive and memorable
--name "Neon Street Racer"
--name "Crystal Cave Adventure"
--name "Mech Defense Force"
--name "Stellar Exploration"
```

#### **Consider Future Expansion**
```bash
# Name should accommodate growth
--name "Space Pirates"  # Can grow to include trading, exploration, combat
--name "Elemental Warrior"  # Can expand with different elements, abilities
--name "City Builder Pro"  # Room for advanced features, expansions
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Management Workflows

### **1. Multi-Project Development**

#### **Organize by Development Stage**
```bash
# Active development projects
npm run director:new "Main RPG project" --name "Epic Quest"           # Primary focus
npm run director:new "Puzzle prototype" --name "Mind Bender"          # Secondary project

# Experimental/prototype projects  
npm run director:new "Physics experiment" --name "Gravity Lab"        # Testing concepts
npm run director:new "Art style test" --name "Visual Prototype"       # Style exploration
```

#### **Genre-Based Organization**
```bash
# Different game types for variety
npm run director:new "Action platformer" --name "Hero's Journey"      # Action game
npm run director:new "Strategy game" --name "Empire Builder"          # Strategy game  
npm run director:new "Puzzle game" --name "Logic Master"              # Puzzle game

```

### **2. Project Switching Strategy**

#### **Context Switching Best Practices**
```bash
# Always check current project before switching
npm run director:list --active

# Switch to specific project with clear intent
npm run director activate 2025-07-17T22-03-47_epic-quest_abc123
echo "Now working on: Epic Quest RPG"

# Make focused changes when switching
npm run director continue "Add boss battle mechanics"

# Switch back to previous project
npm run director activate 2025-07-17T22-05-12_mind-bender_def456  
npm run director continue "Add puzzle difficulty progression"
```

#### **Project State Management**
```bash
# Document project status before switching
# Add comments to project.json or create progress notes

# Use descriptive continue messages
npm run director continue "Implement save/load system - needed for testing"
npm run director continue "Add final boss - completing main story arc"
```

## üöÄ AI Agent Optimization

### **1. Auto-Enqueue Usage**

#### **When to Use Auto-Enqueue (-e flag)**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Use auto-enqueue for:
# - Core system implementations
node scripts/director-enhanced.js new "Basic platformer engine" -e

# - Well-defined feature additions  
node scripts/director-enhanced.js continue "Add sound effects" -e

# - System completions
node scripts/director-enhanced.js continue "Implement inventory system" -e
```

#### **When to Manual Queue**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Manual queue for:
# - Experimental features (review epics first)
npm run director continue "Test new game mechanic idea"

# - Complex systems (may need epic adjustment)  
npm run director continue "Add multiplayer networking"

# - Polish work (may want to prioritize differently)
npm run director continue "Add visual effects and animations"
```

### **2. Epic Quality Optimization**

#### **Provide Context in Prompts**
```bash
# ‚ùå Lacking context
npm run director continue "Add enemies"

# ‚úÖ Rich context for better epics
npm run director continue "Add flying enemies with dive-bomb attack patterns and explosion effects"

# ‚úÖ System-aware context
npm run director continue "Add boss enemies that use the existing power-up system but with unique abilities"
```

#### **Build on Existing Systems**
```bash
# Reference existing game elements
npm run director continue "Enhance the jumping mechanics with wall-jumping and double-jump abilities"
npm run director continue "Expand the weapon system with upgradeable components and special ammunition"
npm run director continue "Add enemies that interact with the existing environmental puzzle elements"
```

## üìä Development Monitoring

### **1. Progress Tracking**

#### **Regular Project Reviews**
```bash
# Weekly project status check
npm run director:list

# Review epic completion
cat "scripts/projects/active-project/epics/epics.json"

# Check agent activity
ls "scripts/projects/active-project/tasks/completed/"
```

#### **Development Metrics**
Track:
- **Epics per session**: Aim for 5-8 focused epics
- **Feature completion rate**: Monitor task queue progress  
- **Project complexity growth**: Note epic count over time
- **Agent distribution**: Balance across coder/designer/uiux agents

### **2. Quality Assurance**

#### **Epic Review Process**
```bash
# 1. Generate epics without auto-enqueue
npm run director continue "Add feature"

# 2. Review generated epics
cat "scripts/projects/active-project/epics/epics.json"

# 3. Manual enqueue if satisfied
node scripts/enqueue.js

# 4. Or regenerate with adjusted prompt
npm run director continue "Add feature with specific requirements"
```

#### **Testing Integration Points**
- **After core systems**: Test basic gameplay loop
- **After UI additions**: Test user interactions
- **After content additions**: Test progression and balance
- **Before major features**: Ensure stability

## üé® Asset and Content Management

### **1. AI Image Generation Optimization**

#### **Effective Asset Prompts**
```bash
# Include style and context in feature requests
npm run director continue "Add retro-style player character with pixel art aesthetic"
npm run director continue "Add sci-fi UI elements with neon glow effects"
npm run director continue "Add fantasy environment backgrounds with mystical atmosphere"
```

#### **Asset Consistency**
- **Maintain style coherence** across iterations
- **Reference existing assets** in new feature requests
- **Specify asset relationships** (character matches environment, UI matches theme)

### **2. Content Expansion Strategies**

#### **Horizontal Expansion** (Breadth)
```bash
# Add variety within existing systems
npm run director continue "Add 3 new enemy types with different movement patterns"
npm run director continue "Add 5 new levels with unique environmental challenges"
npm run director continue "Add multiple weapon types with different firing patterns"
```

#### **Vertical Expansion** (Depth)
```bash
# Deepen existing systems
npm run director continue "Add skill trees and character progression to existing combat"
npm run director continue "Add combo system and advanced techniques to existing movement"
npm run director continue "Add crafting and upgrade system to existing inventory"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Professional Development Practices

### **1. Version Control Integration**

#### **Project Structure for Git**
```bash
# Each project is Git-ready with proper .gitignore
cd "scripts/projects/your-project-folder"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project structure"

# Track iterations as commits
npm run director continue "Add feature"
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: specific description"
```

#### **Branch Strategy for Features**
```bash
# Create feature branches for major additions
git checkout -b feature/boss-battles
npm run director continue "Add boss battle system"
# ... development happens ...
git checkout main
git merge feature/boss-battles
```

### **2. Documentation Standards**

#### **Project Documentation**
Each project should maintain:
- **README.md**: Game description, controls, features
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Technical notes, decisions, next steps
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Feature additions and iterations

#### **Epic Documentation** 
```bash
# Use descriptive epic titles and descriptions
npm run director continue "Add comprehensive save system with multiple slots, auto-save, and cloud sync support"

# Document major system decisions
npm run director continue "Implement physics engine - choosing Phaser Arcade Physics for simplicity and performance"
```
